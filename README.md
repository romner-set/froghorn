[froghorn.exe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BwDECuA0zs) except I made it into an actual program

there should be a [release](https://github.com/romner-set/froghorn/releases) with the exe or whatever you can just download if I'm not lazy

you can also just compile it as a standard rust project, or run `nix run github:romner-set/froghorn` if you have nix
